note bottom of discover_rules : Finds rule files in specified directory and matches them with given extension.
note bottom of execute_command : Executes a command in a subprocess and measures the execution time.
note bottom of extract_solver_runtimes : Extracts runtimes from solver outputs based on environment specifics.
note right of run_experiment : Prepares input, executes solver, processes output, and saves results.
note right of main : Parses arguments and orchestrates the experiment process.
